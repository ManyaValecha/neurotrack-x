**NeuroTrack X** is an AI-powered cognitive health platform built to demonstrate the capabilities of Microsoft Azure AI. It continuously monitors subtle speech patterns to detect early cognitive risk trends years before traditional diagnosis.

This repository contains the frontend demonstration developed for the **Microsoft Imagine Cup**.

## 🚀 Live Demo / Features

Currently running locally.

### Key Modules
1.  **Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of the *Cognitive Risk Index (CRI)*.
2.  **Voice Assessment**: Interactive speech recording interface simulating Azure Cognitive Services processing.
3.  **Clinical Analytics**: Explainable AI insights breaking down risk factors (speech rate, pauses, vocabulary).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
-   **Styling**: TailwindCSS, Framer Motion (Animations)
-   **Visualization**: Recharts
-   **Icons**: Lucide React
